# Hospital Management System
## Overview
The Hospital Management System is a web-based application developed in C# ASP.NET Framework. It uses the MVC pattern and is built using Entity Framework for database interactions.
The project is designed to help manage hospital operations. Patients can book appointments and view their medical history, doctors can manage schedules and prescriptions, and administrators can oversee users, departments, and appointments. The system ensures smooth and efficient hospital management through role-based access.

## Technologies Used
- C# (Backend Logic)
- ASP.NET MVC (Web Framework)
- Entity Framework (ORM for database interaction)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend technologies)
- Bootstrap (Responsive front-end framework)
- jQuery (JavaScript library for client-side interactions)

- Dynamic Interactions: jQuery is used for form validation, AJAX calls, and other client-side interactions.
- Custom Dialogs and Modals: Bootbox is integrated to provide enhanced alert modals for confirmation dialogs (e.g., deletion confirmation).
- Secure and Scalable: The system has been designed with security in mind, incorporating user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Additionally, it can be scaled to accommodate larger hospital environments.
